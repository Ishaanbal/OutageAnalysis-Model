## Analyzing Intentional Attacks on Electricity Providers

When we think of power outages, we usually associate them with crazy weather patterns or infrastructure failure. However, intentional attacks to our electricity grid are on the rise. These acts of domestic terror often cause serious damage and go unpunished. Therefore, we raise the research question of how to minimize these attacks to avoid Americans getting left in the dark.

## Introduction

Our dataset covers power outages from the years 2000 to 2016 in the US. Power outages due to intentional attacks are on the rise, and we must address them to avoid blackouts. In addition, these systems could be exploited by a malicious actor on a more international scale. In order to avoid power outages and address this vulernability in our national security, we have to get better at stopping attackers from bringing down our power grid. 

In this project, we decided to study power outages caused by intentional attacks to determine how a power company could avoid outages due to factors like vandalism or sabotage.

To explore our research question, we looked at plenty of data from our 1534 row dataset. We considered factors like when the outage happened (YEAR, MONTH), where the outage happened (U.S._STATE, CLIMATE.REGION, NERC.REGION), why the outage happened (CAUSE.CATEGORY, CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL), and the impact of the outage (OUTAGE.DURATION, CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED).
