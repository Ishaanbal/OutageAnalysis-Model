## Analyzing Intentional Attacks on Electricity Providers

When we think of power outages, we usually associate them with crazy weather patterns or infrastructure failure. However, intentional attacks to our electricity grid are on the rise. These acts of domestic terror often cause serious damage and go unpunished. Therefore, we raise the research question of how to minimize these attacks to avoid Americans getting left in the dark.
